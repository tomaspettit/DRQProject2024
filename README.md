* **Express.js** - a fast, flexible and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's effectively a tool that simplifies building web applications and APIs using JavaScript on the server side. Express is an open-source that is developed and maintained by the Node.js foundation.
* **React** - one of the most popular JavaScript libraries to develop powerful, interactive web applications. Youâ€™ll learn how to start with React and build up to dynamic user interfaces. It is used to build single-page applications.
* **Node.js** - a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.
